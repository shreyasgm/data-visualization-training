Getting Started
===============
Please follow these steps to install necessary software before the session:

- Download and install R_
- Download and install RStudio_
- Download and install `Tableau Public`_. You may be asked to sign up with your email address.

.. tip:: 

	There are tons of resources to learn R online, but my favourite is Datacamp_. Note that knowledge of R is **not** a pre-requisite; we will walk through each line of code at the session.

.. tip:: 

	If you're interested in starting out before the session with Tableau Public, just open it up and play around with it. If you want more structure, here are some `YouTube tutorials`_.
