In teams of 2, select one of the following 10 datasets to use. Your task is to:

1. Get a basic understanding of the data set: use the internet, make summary statistics, etc.
2. Explore the data and think about some questions you might want to answer through visual representation of the data
3. Choose an audience that you will create a visualization and a report for: government officials, a private sector partner, your PIs, a classroom of college students, etc.
4. Choose what tools you will choose to produce the visualization (Raw, Tableau,  R, STATA, etc.)
5. Get to work and produce an interesting graphic that (i) clearly highlights what you are investigating (in terms of variables, measures, dimensions, etc.) (ii) is easily digestible and (iii) is supported by a description substantiating your findings (even if there are none)
6. Email us your final visualization (PNG / URL). We will put each of these visualizations up, and you will get to quickly explain your intent and findings (if any).
